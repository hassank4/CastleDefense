# Meeting 

For our meeting, the only person who could not make it to the sprint meeting was Humza Afzal (Scrum Master) because of a personal matter. Other than that, everyone else was able to make it to the meeting. We presented four of our classes and how it functions well without any bugs. The classes we presented were Enemy, Start Screen, Game Map and Tower. For the Enemy and Tower classes, we showed that we can make an enemy and tower object as well as showing that these objects have the functionality to lose health. For the Start Screen and Game Map classes, we showed that they display on the screen with the correct dimensions. During this meeting we discussed what each of our classes did, their purpose, their attributes and methods as well as how we will link these classes together in the future. We came up with the idea that we are going to use the Model-View-Controller design pattern moving forward as all group members are well aware of how that design pattern works.

# Sprint Goal
We completed our sprint goal as it was to complete the Enemy, Tower, Defense, Projectile, Start Game, and Game Map classes without any bugs. Completing these classes were our user stories for Sprint 1 and they were all done in a timely manner. The main objective of this sprint was the get the basis of our classes so we can use their methods and attributes to create more complex designs in future sprints. Thus, the goal of this sprint was to make basic classes for the main objects of our game. As stated previously, this was completed in a timely fashion.

# Spikes

We did not encounter any spikes for this Sprint. We kept this sprint relatively short since we did not have any classes to start with, so we had to start from scratch. We did not want any conflicts between classes for future sprints, so we kept every class at its basic stage for now. For these reasons, everyone was able to complete their user stories in time without any bugs.

# Task Breakdown
There were a total of 6 tasks (user stories) in this sprint. There were the Start Screen, Game Map, Tower Defense, Projectile and Enemy classes that were said to be completed by the end of this sprint. They were assigned to Thamodh, Khadijah, Bikramjit, Hassan, Humza and Kevin respectively. The breakdown was fair as no one was overwhelmed with the work they had to complete as everyone finished their task with time to spare. One reason for this is because Sprint 1 is said to be the basis or set-up of our application, thus there were not any exhaustive tasks in this sprint. Moving forward, we intend to tackle bigger tasks such as the high score menu and interaction all objects to the game map to run the game.
