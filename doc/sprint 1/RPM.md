# Release Planning Meeting

**Meeting**

The meeting conducted comprised of various discussions about the user stories that we have completed so far and what user stories were left to do. Khadijah and Thamodh were the ones we who made the initial GUIs for the application. Khadijah made the game map and Thamodh made the start screen. Both the GUIs have interfaces that do not interact with any of the classes thus far, however as discussed by both Thamodh and Khadijah, in later user stories we will be able to connect the GUIs to the classes to display objects and run the application.

Humza, Bikramjit, Kevin and Hassan made the projectile, tower, enemy and defence classes respectively. These classes are the basis of our application as they will represent the game objects when the application is running. They discussed the attributes of their respective classes verbally to ensure that there were no attributes missing. This was a crucial step because moving forward we need to ensure all attributes and methods are included in the classes when we instantiate the classes into objects. 

We also discussed what design patterns we are going to use for the classes to interact with each other. We all decided that we will be using the Model-View-Controller pattern to display the game to the users. We came to this decision as all of us have prior experience implementing this design pattern so we felt it was best.

**Participants**

All members (Thamodh Egodawatte, Bikramjit Saini, Kevin Subhash, Hassan Kamal and Khadijah Mosaheb) were able to able to participate in the Release Planning Meeting except for Humza Afzal, as he had an important matter to deal with. Despite the fact that Humza Afzal was our scrum master, we were able to conduct the meeting without him as we had discussed the potential release goals informally prior to the actual Release Planning Meeting.

**Release Goals**

Some of the release goals we discussed are: 

- A working application with a start screen, a help menu and a game map 
- The game map using the Projectile, Tower, Enemy and Defense objects to interact in a way such that the enemies attack the tower and the defences have to protect the towers using projectile objects 
- User has the ability to place defence objects onto the game map in the positioning of their choosing 
- Points get tallied and the user with the most points is recorded on a high scores menu 
- Ability to quit the current game while saving it to be loaded later
