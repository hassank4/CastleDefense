# Team Organization
When organizing the team, we first voted for Humza as scrum master and then let him propose the division for the deliverables according to our strengths. Then we talked about whether or not we agreed on the division. On average, it took us about 2 rounds of voting for each decision.
The roles themselves were assigned as follows:
- Summary - Thamodh
- Competition - Hassan
- Product Backlog & JIRA - Bikramjit & Humza
- Done - Thamodh
- Personas - Kevin
- Process - Bikramjit
- User Experience - Khadijah

# User Stories
When deciding on the priority of user stories, we started by agreeing on which features we thought are absolutely necessary (like the basic map and tower). These are required for the game to have basic functionality and be playable. For the rest we just did our normal voting to go from easy to hard based on our previous experience.

# Meetings & Moving Forward
For our meetings we just talked over our group chat on Facebook because we weren't at school at the time we were deciding. Moving forward, we are going to continue our voting process because it worked really well with little to no disagreement. If there are disagreements, however, we will try a new way of voting with first and second options so if there is any disagreement, everyone's second option will also be considered.
