# Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants**

The participants in this sprint 3 retrospective meeting were Thamodh Egodawatte, Kevin Subhash, Humza Afzal, 
Bikramjit Saini, Hassan Kamal and Khadijah Mosaheb. For this sprint meeting, everyone was able to attend which made
the task breakdown and analysis much easier. With everyone being there, we had the ability to collaborate as a group 
and everyone’s input was taken into account.

**Unfinished Tasks**

Unfortunately, we were unable to complete two parts of our user stories. The first part we were unable to complete was
having the ability to spawn in several enemies at the same time. For now, we were only able to implement a feature that
spawns one enemy at a time. However we have been researching and thinking of new implementations for this feature that we
can complete in the next sprint. The second part we were unable to complete this sprint was the ability to have the defences
detect oncoming enemies and attack them. We had a solid understanding of the implementation however due to time constraints 
we were unable to complete that part of the user story. We firmly believe we will be able to finish these two parts in the 
next sprint.

**Good Practices**

One reason we were able to finish most of the user stories is because of the daily stand-ups we did. Over the course of the 
2 week sprint, we had 5 stand-ups and we talked everyday on Facebook Messenger to ensure that there was communication daily. 
We understood that since now we were connecting important parts of the game together, we need to make sure everyone understands
how the implementation for certain parts work. Another good practice during this sprint was the planning of the user stories. 
Though it was difficult at first to understand exactly how the code for other team member’s classes worked, we ended up 
finishing the tasks with minimal merge conflicts and most of the implementation we set out to complete was completed. 


**New Practices**

One new practice we are considering trying in future sprints having a bigger user story broken into even smaller parts and
splitting the parts among multiple team members. We believe that this will ensure we complete the bigger user story in the
given time frame as well as it being less work for a single person to implement. Since the next sprint is our last sprint,
we hope to divide the big tasks equally and put in a lot of effort to finish the game in time. Another new practice we would
like to introduce in future sprints is trying to understand the user stories of others. As a group, it is essential to know
how the entire software works irregardless of the user stories an individual worked on. This will definitely help us during
the presentation as every group member will know exactly how each part of the software works. Thus, we will ensure we discuss
our user stories with the other group members next sprint.


**Harmful Practices**

One harmful practice we did throughout the sprint is not properly calculating the timeframe of each user story. During 
our initial meeting at the start of sprint 3, we added user stories that were a bit difficult to complete for one person.
In the next sprint , we hope to split tasks into smaller parts so that we complete all given tasks on time. Another harmful
practice that we wish to abolish in future sprints is to stop working independently on user stories. We hope that in the next
sprint we talk about our user stories more openly with others in our group. This way everyone will know exactly what is going 
on and they will even be able to propose solutions if someone is stuck in their user story.


**Experience**

One of the best experiences in this sprint was seeing the game come together. Since in this sprint most of the initial set
up was complete, it was more exciting to actually work on the game aspect of our software.

One of the worst experiences in this sprint was trying to implement a way for the defences to detect oncoming enemies and
attack them. We have the code and design that accounts this user story. However we were having trouble finding an 
implementation that links the code and displays it onto the user interface.
