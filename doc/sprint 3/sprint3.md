# Meeting

For our meeting, everyone was in attendance. We presented four of our newly implemented features and how they function. The first feature was the ability to add defences into the game. For this feature, you just need to drag the defence you want to use onto the map, and it will subtract the cost from the user’s total coins that are available. Secondly, we showcased the ability for an enemy to follow the path of the map. For this feature, the slope and distance were calculated so that the enemy can move from point to point smoothly and deletes itself when it reaches the end of the path. The third feature was the ability to modify the database containing high scores. High scores can be inserted, deleted, or updated through the database. The final feature was adding a point class. This point class contains enemy objects and assigns a certain number of points to each enemy, and those points are converted into high scores for the database.

# Sprint Goal

Our sprint goal was to get a working game at its initial stages. This time we reached about 85% of the goal. The reason why we did not reach our sprint goal completely is because defences cannot attack enemies and defences can be placed anywhere which it should not do.

# Spikes
In this sprint we ran into two spikes. The first spike was being able to spawn several enemies one by one. The second spike was making the defences detect and attack an enemy. We could not find a solution to make these work this sprint due to time constraints. Since we are close to the possible solutions, we should be able to complete it in the next sprint.

# Task Breakdown
There was a total of 6 tasks (user stories) in this sprint. These were:
1)	Ability to drag defences on to the map and subtract the cost form user’s total coins
2)	Ability to get enemy to follow a path
3)	Ability to get defences to attack enemies
4)	Creating High Scores menu
5)	Ability to insert, delete, and update high scores on the database
6)	Creating a points class for high scores

These were assigned to Khadijah, Kevin, Humza, Thamodh, Bikramjit, and Hassan respectively. The breakdown was somewhat fair. By this, we mean that everyone was given a single task, however, one task was a lot harder than other ones. Number 3 from the list above was the harder task. Since 3 was harder, it did lead to a spike as stated above. Moving forward, we plan on implementing new features such as connecting the points to the database and having defences detect and attack enemies.
