# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants**

The participants in this sprint 1 retrospective meeting were Thamodh Egodawatte, Kevin Subhash, Hassan Kamal, Bikramjit Saini and Khadijah Mosaheb. Unfortunately, our scrum master Humza Afzal was unable to attend the meeting due to a personal event. However, this issue was discussed prior to the meeting so there were no confusion or concerns. 

**Unfinished Tasks**

Fortunately, we were able to complete all 6 user stories that were assigned to us during this sprint. The user stories that were assigned and completed during this sprint were the start screen, game map, defence, enemy, tower and projectile classes. There were no outstanding tasks left to complete at the end of this sprint.

**Good Practices**

One reason we were able to complete all user stories and tasks on time is because we each created our own branch and started working on our tasks earlier in the the sprint. This is a really good practice because when it comes to software development, there can be many issues and bugs that are unexpected. Thus, it is really important to start the task earlier rather than later. Another good practice we had during this sprint was communicating on Microsoft Teams for stand ups as well as communication externally on Facebook Messenger to ensure we were all on the same page. When it comes to projects like this, communication is key; so it is a good practice that we are constantly communicating.

**New Practices**

One new practice we are considering trying in future sprints is replying to stand ups directly under the scrum master’s posts. In previous stand ups, some team members would make their own thread as a reply to the scrum master’s stand up. However, this would make it confusing to distinguish between the stand ups. Therefore, in the future we will make it clear to all group members that they need to reply directly under the scrum master’s post for each sprint to make it easier to visualize for the future. Another new practice we are considering for the future is to have more formal meetings throughout the sprint. Most of our meetings were informal and done over text messages. We feel that having a formal meeting will ensure everyone is on the same page and they can express any concerns or questions they have about the project as it develops throughout the sprint.

**Harmful Practices**

One harmful practice we did throughout the sprint is not discussing the work we did daily to each other, Though this might seem unnecessary, it is crucial to know where everyone is and what they need to complete their task. Luckily, it did not affect us during this sprint, but in future sprints where more software is being implemented, it is essential that we state explicitly how our code works so the other team members can adjust their code accordingly and resolve merge conflicts. Another harmful practice we did was not adding clear comments to code for some classes. This is key when it comes to interacting with other developers as another team member should be able to read your comments and understand how the code should work. We look to improve on these two harmful practices in future sprints. 

**Experience**

One of the best experiences in this sprint was designing our own classes and communicating how it would work. The concept of splitting the entire project into smaller tasks made it much easier for an individual team member to finish their task on time. All team members started their tasks early so it made the sprint easier to complete.

One of the worst experiences in this sprint was the pull requests on GitHub. At first, it was very confusing to understand how exactly the pull requests worked. However, after a while we finally understood the concept of doing the pull requests and the process became clearer.
