For our group, we have decided to use the following guidelines and rules to outline what is considered “done” for each user story:

A user story is said to be “done” if…

# Standard Definitions:

- All the requirements in the user story description are met and code or software adheres to the outline and purpose of the user story
- No details from the user story description are left out or ignored
- The user story functions with minimal to no bugs (here we will define minimal as 1-3 bugs that do not require more than a day to fix)
- No merge conflicts are created when the user story is finished 

# Additional Definitions:

- Extra features are added if time permits
- Developer goes “above and beyond” and implements better and more efficient code along the way
- Fixes any bugs in previous code or user stories

If the above requirements or guidelines under “Standard Definitions" are all met, then we are to say that a user story is “done” for our project. The “Additional Definitions” are considered a bonus and it is not needed for a user story to be considered “done”.
