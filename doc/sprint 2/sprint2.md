# Meeting 

For our meeting, the only person who could not make it to the sprint meeting was Hassan Kamal because of a personal matter. Other than that, everyone else was able to attend the meeting. We presented four of our classes and how it functions well without any bugs. The first was functional buttons on the menu screen. The buttons allow the user to access the help menu, pause menu, high score menu and to start the actual game. Secondly, we showcased 3 new enemy types that inherit from the Enemy class. The enemies implemented were ogre, mage, and assassin where each type had their own unique speed, attack damage, and health. These enemies can interact with a tower object and affect the tower’s health. Thirdly, we showed how an Enemy object now has a position using x and y coordinates and how the Enemy class had a move method which allows the object to move by changing it’s position by updating its x and y coordinates. For our final one, we showcased how a tower now has a placeable area. The edges of the path on the game map was mapped by placing points around the curves. Those points were then connected together to create boxes that represent where the tower can be placed. 

# Sprint Goal

Our sprint goal was to get a working game at its initial stages, but we could not reach that goal. There were a lot of complications for placing enemies and defences on the map as well as making the enemy follow the path of the map. In addition, as a group, we gave ourselves too much work this sprint when some of the work should have been saved for sprint 3. To get a working game is still our goal for the next sprint since we as a team believe we are very close.

# Spikes

This sprint, we did run into two spikes. The first is being able to place the enemies and defences on the screen. The second is making an enemy follow the path on the map. These were the main reasons why we could not reach our sprint goal this time. We could not find a solution to make these work this sprint, but with more research we think we can get it done in the next sprint for sure.

# Task Breakdown
There was a total of 6 tasks (user stories) in this sprint. These were:
1)	Designing and creating new Enemy types
2)	Designing and creating new Defence types
3)	Adding button functionalities 
4)	Implementing Enemy movement (following path of map)
5)	Placing Enemy and Defence objects on the game map
6)	Creating a placeable area on the map for a Tower object

These were assigned to Kevin, Hassan, Thamodh, Bikramjit, Khadijah, and Humza respectively. The breakdown was somewhat fair. By this, we mean that everyone was given a single task, however, some tasks were a lot harder than other ones. Numbers 4 and 5 from the list above were the harder tasks. Since 4 and 5 were harder, it did lead to a few spikes as stated above. Moving forward, we plan on getting rid of those spikes and implementing new features such as animations, interactions between an Enemy and Projectile, and potentially adding a database that keeps track of the user’s scores.
