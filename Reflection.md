# Reflection

When looking back at the final product that our team put together, there are definitely things that we did well, 
things that we did not do well and things we could have done better in the future. 

**The Good**

The tools that worked well for us was the use of MongoDB. All 6 team members had individual experience using
MongoDB for previous work so it was not difficult to incorporate the use of MongoDB to have a local database running 
in the background of our application. One the techniques that worked really well for us was the MVC design pattern. For
our product, we used a hybrid version of the MVC pattern as we had the Controller and the Model in the same file. It
worked really well because the logic of the game (Controller) would manipulate the Model in the same file and both 
components would work together to display the game to the View accordingly.

**The Bad**

One tool that did not work exactly how we wanted to work was the use of the Python library pygame to design and 
implement our game. The reason we used pygame was because of the fact that everyone in our group had prior experience
using pygame in the past. We thought that this would make it easier to design and build the application however we
realized that there were many features that took way longer than expected to complete due to the lack of resources 
in pygame. Features that should be done in a few lines of code took methods and even classes to function the way we 
wanted. Additionally, the technique of keeping user stories independent made it easier to work on a specific feature 
without reliance on the code of others. However, this created further complications when it came to putting the entire
game together. Since many of the stories were done independently, some team members were not aware of how some components
of the software worked. This slowed down the process towards the end as members were confused and had to rely on others
to communicate their implementation or figure it out for themselves.

**The Future**

Lastly, if we were to continue working on this project as a team, we would keep the agile development aspect of it the 
same. The agile methodology made the project easy to manage and ensured we were able to complete the project on a given
timeline. When it comes to the exact implementation of the product, we would use a different software to design the game.
A game engine like Unity would be better for us. There are sure to be built in functions and animations that would make
our software much cleaner and visually appealing. Also we would also use a software like C# to implement our code instead
of Python. All in all, we were definitely satisfied with the final project but we know where to improve for the future.
