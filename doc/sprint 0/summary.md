# Objective: 

The main objective for our application is to create a strategy game that works as most tower defence games do where enemies try to reach the end of a map while the player tries to place defences to stop them from attacking.

# Overall Gameplay:

Enemies will approach onto the screen and travel their way through the map. The playerâ€™s goal is to position towers in such a way that they will be able to defeat the oncoming enemies by reducing their health to 0. However, the towers themselves will also have a health bar, so they can also be defeated. The game is finished if the player completes all enemy attack rounds with towers standing or if the enemies defeat the main tower located at the end of the map. There will also be a high scores menu where players will stack up based on how efficiently they played as the high score menu is based on time it took to complete the game.

# Key Users:

**Player:** The player is the most important user because they are the ones who participate in using the application by playing the game. 



# Key Scenarios:

**Enemy enters the Map:** When an enemy enters the map, they have a health bar that is set to full. Some enemies might have a bigger health bar than others. Enemies may also carry weapons which they can use to attack towers. The goal of the towers is to defeat these enemies as soon as possible because if a certain number of them reach the end of the map, the main tower loses health.

**Defence is placed onto the Map:** A player can place the the defence on a select area on the map. The selected area covers most of the map, however it does interfere with the path of the enemies. The defence also has a health bar and once the health bar is zero, then then the defence is defeated and disappears off the map. Just like the enemies, the towers can have different health bars and different weapons and abilities.

**The main tower loses all health:** Once the main tower loses all its health, the game is over and the player loses. The main objective for the player is to protect that main tower at all costs by defeating enemies before they reach the main tower. 

**Player survives all rounds:** If the player survives all rounds, then the player wins the game and the time it took to complete the game is recorded for the high scores menu.



# Key Principles:

- A tower cannot be placed on the path the enemies will use to traverse through the map; defences can only be planted in select regions which will be clearly marked on the map
- There will be a system in place to stop the user from filling the entire map with towers; there is a cost to place a defences onto the map and the user can earn currency to purchase more defences by defeating enemies 
- The main tower is located at the end of the map; if the main tower loses all its health, then the player loses the game and their time will not be recorded onto the high scores menu
- Enemies will come in waves or rounds; it is up to the user to strategically place towers in certain areas to ensure the survival of the main tower
- Both the defences and enemies have specific abilities that allow the to attack each other; for instance some defences might have a strong attack and others might have an extended health bar 
- Additionally, enemies and defences have a health bar; once an enemy or tower loses all its health, it will disappear from the map
