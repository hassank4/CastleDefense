# Sprint 4 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants**

The participants in this sprint 4 retrospective meeting were Thamodh Egodawatte, Kevin Subhash, Humza Afzal, 
Bikramjit Saini, Hassan Kamal and Khadijah Mosaheb. For this sprint meeting, everyone was able to attend which made
the task breakdown and analysis much easier. With everyone being there, we had the ability to collaborate as a group and 
everyoneâ€™s input was taken into account.

**Unfinished Tasks**

Considering that this was our last sprint, we all worked extremely hard and ensured that there were no tasks left
unfinished. We all started with the highest priority tasks because our sprint goal was to get a working game. Once the 
highest priority tasks were complete, we started fixing minor bugs and adding additional features. All in all, we met our
sprint goal and the game is functioning how we wanted it to.

**Good Practices**

One reason we were able to finish most of the user stories is because of the daily stand-ups we did. Over the course 
of the 2 week sprint, we had 5 stand-ups and we talked everyday on Facebook Messenger to ensure that there was communication
daily. We understood that since now we were connecting important parts of the game together, we need to make sure everyone
understands how the implementation for certain parts work. Another good practice during this sprint was video calling and
discussing the implementation of specific parts. Some user stories built off of other user stories, so these videos calls 
ensured that everyone understood how previous coded software worked. After some calls, everyone understood how the game 
worked so there was no need to spend time calling, which made the development process go by faster and more efficiently. 

**New Practices**

For future projects, we wish to utilize the same good practices we have been using for this project. However we would 
definitely like to add some new practices to the mix as well. One new practice we would like to implement in the future 
is having more people working on the design phase of the application. The reason for this is because the user will want to 
see the best user interface possible, so in future projects we will make sure to emphasize that in the project planning 
phase. Another new practice we wish to implement is the idea of having more testing in the final phases of the project. 
Testing is important to see whether software behaves the way it is supposed to. There could have more testing done in the 
final phase of this project, so we know to ensure this is the case in future projects.

**Harmful Practices**

One harmful practice we did throughout the sprint is not testing properly before merging into master. Sometimes with 
the smaller user story we only checked if the code compiles and run with a basic test case. We realize that this is not 
ideal because the master branch should never have any errors, so it crucial we rigorously test our branch before merging 
into master. Another harmful practice that was performed in this sprint was the fact that we saved fixing the bugs until 
the end. Whenever a bug is noticed, it should be dealt with right away because it could create further complications in 
the program. 

**Experience**

Now that the project is done and we have a working game, it can be recognized that the experience was definitely great.
All of us learned a lot about pygame, project management, and the overall software development lifecycle. Despite the 
fact that the overall experience was great, there were definitely some experiences that were not as good. We struggled 
with making GUIs with pygame as there was a learning curve. Also, using the pymongo library to implement MongoDB as our 
local database also took some time to learn. All in all, we took away a lot from designing and building this project and 
it can be said that it is something we are all proud of.
