# Sprint 4 Planning Meeting:

**Team Capacity:** 6

**Members at Meeting:** 2

**Participants:** Kevin Subhash, Thamodh Egodawatte

# Meeting 

For our sprint meeting, several people could not make it due to the sudden notice of having an online call because of the COVID-19 situation. However, Thamodh and Kevin still presented four of the functional features without any bugs. The first was having several enemies spawning on the map. Out of the three enemies (Assassin, Mage, and Ogre), the game randomly chooses the enemy to spawn with a time delay so that enemies do not spawn at the same time and there is a good distance between enemies. Secondly, defences attacking enemies was implemented. A defence that is placed down can shoot projectiles at the enemies which causes the enemies’ health to reduce which can result in death. Thirdly, the point system being implemented. The point system adds up the number of assassins, mages, and ogres that were killed by the defences placed and awards the total points to the user which is considered the score. For our final one, we showcased how the game can interact with the database using MongoDB. Anytime when a player receives a new high score, it is stored into the database with the player’s name and new score. New players will automatically be added with their first received score.  

# Sprint Goal

Our sprint goal was to get a working game and we finally reached that goal. As a team, we were able to complete all the features that were needed for the game to be playable. Future implementations for the game will be bug fixes but we do not plan on implementing any new features anytime soon.





# Spikes
For this sprint, we did not run into any spikes. We did not have a lot of new features to implement since the game was very close to being done. As a team, we had a lot of time to research so that we can solve new problems we encountered. For this reason, we suspect that is why we did not have any spikes this sprint. 

# Task Breakdown
There was a total of 6 main tasks (user stories) in this sprint. These were:
1)	Spawning multiple enemies onto the map with a time delay
2)	Implement the point system and display it on the map
3)	Connect High scores GUI to the database with user’s name
4)	Connect the current high score points to the database
5)	Add the main tower to the game map
6)	Make defences attack enemies and add animations

These were assigned to Kevin, Hassan, Thamodh, Bikramjit, Khadijah, and Humza respectively. The breakdown was fair. By this, we mean that everyone was given a single task and all the 6 tasks that were assigned had about the same difficulty. Everyone was able to complete their user stories in time without any problems.
