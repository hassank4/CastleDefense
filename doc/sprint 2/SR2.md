# Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting


**Participants**

The participants in this sprint 2 retrospective meeting were Thamodh Egodawatte, Kevin Subhash, Humza Afzal, Bikramjit Saini
and Khadijah Mosaheb. Unfortunately, Hassan Kamal was unable to attend the meeting due to a personal event. However, this 
issue was discussed prior to the meeting so there were no confusion or concerns.

**Unfinished Tasks**

Unfortunately, we were unable to complete two parts of our user stories. The first part we were unable to complete is the 
actual placing functionality of the defences. We were able to create classes for the actual defence and enemy objects. 
However due to a lack of time management, we were unable to create buttons to place the defences onto the game map. Another 
task we were unable to find a way to implement a feature on the View to have enemies spawn onto the map. We were able to 
create a function that printed the critical points on the map where enemies would spawn, but we were not able to actually 
display visual enemies on the View.

**Good Practices**

One reason we were able to finish most of the user stories is because of the daily stand-ups we did. Over the course of the 
2 week sprint, we had 5 stand-ups and we talked everyday on Facebook Messenger to ensure that there was communication daily. 
We realize that communication was very important in this sprint because most of user stories were overlapping with other 
files. Thus, we had to ensure that everyone knew the exact implementation of specific classes. Another good practice during 
this sprint was the planning of the user stories. Though it was difficult at first to understand exactly how the code for 
other team memberâ€™s classes worked, we ended up finishing the tasks with minimal merge conflicts.


**New Practices**

One new practice we are considering trying in future sprints multiple team members working on the same user story split into 
different parts. The reason we decided to go with this approach is because we underestimated the difficulty of some of the 
user stories in sprint 2. Some user stories take more time to complete and it would be useful to have a second team member 
help out. So, for future sprints we plan to have multiple team members work on the same user stories but split into different 
tasks. Another new practice we would like to introduce in future sprints is keeping the user stories more reasonable. 
In this sprint, we underestimated the time it took to complete the user stories and we ended up with 2 spikes. In future 
sprints, we will add less user stories to the product backlog. This way, if we do finish our user stories early, we can 
assign ourselves more user stories.


**Harmful Practices**

One harmful practice we did throughout the sprint is not properly calculating the timeframe of each user story. During our 
initial meeting at the start of sprint 2, we added too many user stories to the product backlog that we ended up with 2 major
spikes. For sprint 3, we will ensure that we take time to research more into the user story before committing a number of
points and time frame for it. Another harmful practice that we wish to abolish in future sprints is to stop relying on just 
Facebook Messenger to talk about our specific classes. We wish to use video calls more to visually show group members the code
to make it easier for them to understand when they are creating their related user stories. We believe that the visual aspect
will make it easier for the team members to understand how the code works and how to implement their user stories 
accordingly.


**Experience**

One of the best experiences in this sprint was designing our own classes and communicating how it would work. 
The concept of splitting the entire project into smaller tasks made it much easier for an individual team member 
to finish their task on time. Most of the team members started their tasks early so it made the sprint easier to complete.

One of the worst experiences in this sprint was connecting the placing functionality of the objects onto the game map. 
It was difficult to implement because we were confused on what was the best way to approach the task at hand. However, 
after this meeting we have discussed some potential ideas and wish to implement them in sprint 3.
